![Calculator Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xanmoy/calculator-desktop/main/media/Screenshot%20from%202024-08-07%2003-33-56.png)


A simple desktop calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. This application performs basic arithmetic operations and can be compiled into a standalone executable using PyInstaller.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Simple and user-friendly graphical interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes bundled with Python)
- PyInstaller (for creating standalone executables)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xanmoy/calculator-desktop.git
cd calculator-desktop
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have pyinstaller installed:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```
## Usage
Running the Application
To run the calculator application directly from source:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Creating a Standalone Executable
To create a standalone executable using PyInstaller:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```

The executable will be created in the dist directory. You can then run the executable from the command line or double-click it to start the application.
